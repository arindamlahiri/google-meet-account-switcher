# Google Meet Account Switcher - Chrome Extension <!-- omit in toc -->

Quickly switch between multiple accounts in Google Meet. <br/>
"Why can't I just use the 'Switch Account' feature in Meet?", I hear you ask. When you use that, you are redirected to a new page where you select another account and then you are redirected back. On the other hand when you use this extension, you just need 2 clicks and it's done.

## Setup

1. Download the zip from [here](https://github.com/arindamlahiri/google-meet-account-switcher/raw/main/google-meet-account-switcher.zip) and extract it
2. All the account details are in `accounts.js`. You can edit the details in this file. There are two fields for each account.
3. `displayName` : This is the name by which your account will show up in the extension.
4. `authuser`: In most google apps, google uses a system of numbering our accounts. `0` being the number for the default account in chrome, then `1`,`2` and so on for each account added. For the accounts you want to switch between, you need to know this number. To find out, just go to [https://meet.google.com](https://meet.google.com) . In the top right, whichever account shows up that is your default account (numbered `0`). Then click on your display picture and switch to another account. Now in the address bar you would have something like `?authuser=x`. x is the number we need.
5. Repeat step 4 for all the accounts you want to switch between. You can add or remove accounts in `accounts.js` as per your need. Make sure to follow the same format.

Here's how my `accounts.js` file looks like(Note: I don't use my default account for google meet, hence no `authuser:0` for me) : <br/>
